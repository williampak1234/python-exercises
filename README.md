# Python Practice Exercises

This repository tracks my progress as I sharpen my Python skills through real problem-solving.  
Each script in this repo solves a coding challenge using clear, maintainable logic and industry-standard Python practices.

## What's Inside

- Focused practice on fundamental and intermediate Python topics
- Clean, modular code with input validation and readable structure
- Docstrings and comments following PEP 8 and PEP 257
- Occasional challenges sourced from sites like Edabit, Hyperskill, and others

## Goals

- Build strong muscle memory for writing clean code
- Prepare for technical interviews and project-based internships
- Document and reflect on coding habits and problem-solving strategies

## Notes

Most problems include:
- Problem statement
- Difficulty level
- Brief notes or takeaways
- Function-level docstrings for clarity

## File Structure

Each Python file solves a single problem. 

## Next Steps

As I continue learning, I plan to:
- Refactor earlier solutions for clarity and performance
- Add unit tests for more robust validation
- Group files by topic (e.g., strings, loops, functions)
- Start learning Linux, Networking, and then put my full focus onto Cloud Engineering (specifically Cloud Security)
- Hopefully get an internship!!

I'm always looking to improve, so feedback and ideas are welcome!
